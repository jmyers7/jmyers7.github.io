## Domains of PDEs {.scrollable}

- Solutions to PDEs are functions, often of the form
$$
u(x,t),\quad u(x,y,t), \quad u(x,y,z,t), \quad u(x,y,z), \ldots.
$$
- PDEs are often only considered over a certain domain.
- If $u$ is "time-dependent", this domain often has a "spatial" part and a "time" part.

### c. Domains of Laplace's equation

For each of the following Laplace's equation scenarios, describe the domain of the PDE, including its dimension, being careful to identify the spatial and time parts of the domain.

i. The steady-state temperature $u$ at a certain position of a metal plate of width $x_0$ and height $y_0$. (*Hint*: "steady-state" means that the temperature does not change with time.)
ii. The steady-state temperature $u$ at a certain position of a solid metal sphere of radius $r$.

## Linear differential operators {.scrollable}

- Recall (from the exercises!) that a linear differential operator $L$ is something of the form
$$
L(u) = au + \sum_{i=1}^n b_i \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} + \sum_{i,j=1}^n c_{ij}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + \cdots,
$$
where the sum only includes finitely many terms, and the coefficients are functions only of the independent variables.

- For example, the Laplacian is such an operator:
$$
\nabla^2 u = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i^2}.
$$
If we set $\nabla^2 u=0$, we get Laplace's equation.

- For another example, the operator
$$
L(u) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - k \nabla^2 u,
$$
is linear. If we set $L(u)=0$, we get the heat equation.

- For a third example, the operator
$$
L(u) = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} - a^2 \nabla^2 u,
$$
is linear. If we set $L(u)=0$, we get the wave equation.

### Linear PDEs

A **linear partial differential equation** consists of the following:

1. An equation $L(u) = f$, where $L$ is a linear differential operator and $f$ is some function of the independent variables (but not of $u$ or its derivatives).

2. A specification of the domain over which the equation is considered, i.e., the domains of the solution $u$ and the function $f$.

### Theorem (Superposition principle for homogeneous linear PDEs).

If $u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n$ are solutions to a homogeneous linear PDE, then any linear combination
$$
u = a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \dots + a_n u_n
$$
is also a solution, where $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ are constants.

## Exercise 2: Solutions to non-homogeneous linear PDEs {.scrollable}

::: {.callout-note icon="false" .nonincremental appearance="minimal"}

Let $L(u)=f$ be a non-homogeneous linear PDE, and let $u_p$ be a **particular solution** to this PDE (i.e., $L(u_p)=f$).

a. Let $u_h$ be a solution to the corresponding homogeneous PDE (i.e., $L(u_h)=0$). Show that $u = u_p + u_h$ is also a solution to the non-homogeneous PDE.

b. Show that if $u$ is any solution to the non-homogeneous PDE, then $u - u_p$ is a solution to the homogeneous PDE.

c. Conclude that any solution $u$ to the non-homogeneous PDE can be expressed as
$$
u = u_p + u_h,
$$
where $u_h$ is a solution to the homogeneous PDE.

## Boundary and initial conditions {.scrollable}

- Consider a linear PDE $L(u) = f$ defined over a fixed domain $D$.
- As we saw, the domain $D$ may, or may not, have a "time part". If it does, then the other part of the domain is called the "spatial part".

::: {.callout-note icon="false" .fragment}
### Boundary and initial conditions

- A **boundary condition** is a specification of the values of the solution $u$ (or its derivatives) at the boundary of the spatial part of the domain $D$.

- If the domain has a time part, an **initial condition** is a specification of the values of the solution $u$ (or its derivatives) at the initial time (usually $t=0$).

:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false" .fragment}
### Types of boundary conditions

- **Dirichlet boundary condition**: specifies the value of $u$ at the boundary of the spatial part of the domain.

- **Neumann boundary condition**: specifies the value of the normal derivative of $u$ at the boundary of the spatial part of the domain.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false" .fragment}
### Boundary and initial value problems

- A **boundary value problem** is a linear PDE together with a specification of boundary conditions.

- An **initial value problem** is a linear PDE together with a specification of initial conditions.

## Exercise 3: Boundary and initial conditions {.scrollable}

::: {.callout-note icon="false" .nonincremental appearance="minimal"}

For each of the following scenarios, identify the type of PDE (e.g., heat equation, wave equation, Laplace's equation), the domain $D$ of the problem and describe the boundary and/or initial conditions that would be appropriate for the scenario. Are the boundary conditions Dirichlet or Neumann?

i. The temperature $u$ at a certain position and time of a metal rod of length $L$ that is insulated at both ends and is known to have an initial temperature profile.

ii. The displacement $u$ at a certain position and time of a vibrating string of length $L$ that is fixed at both ends, given that the string is initially at rest but has an initial displacement profile.

iii. The steady-state temperature $u$ at a certain position of a metal plate of width $x_0$ and height $y_0$ that is held at a constant temperature along its boundary and has an initial temperature distribution.
