title: "Partial Differential Equations"
toc: true
---

This course is an introduction to partial differential equations (PDEs). A special emphasis will be placed on solving PDEs via Fourier series, and hence the course also serves as an introduction to Fourier analysis. In particular:

1. We will study the classical PDEs of mathematical physics: the heat equation, the wave equation, and Laplace's equation.
2. We will learn how to solve these equations using separation of variables and Fourier series.
3. Complex variables and complex exponentials will be introduced as tools to help us understand Fourier series.
4. We will study the properties of Fourier series, including convergence theorems and applications to function approximation.
5. Properties of complex exponentials, sines, and cosines will be generalized to abstract properties of functions in $L^2$ spaces. Accordingly, students will be introduced to the notion of Hilbert spaces.
