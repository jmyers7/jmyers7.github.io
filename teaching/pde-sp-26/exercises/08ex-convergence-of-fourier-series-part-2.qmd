# 08 Convergence of Fourier series, part 2

## Exercise 1: Summing infinite series using Fourier series

Recall the method used in Exercise 1 and 2 in class of using a Fourier series to sum an infinite series. This exercise is a continuation of that method, and it makes use of the [table](./img/fourier-series.pdf) of Fourier series that we've used in previous exercises.

For each of the following series, use the table linked above to find the sum of the series.

a. $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{4n^2-1}$

b. $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$

c. $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(2n-1)^3}$

d. $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^2}$
