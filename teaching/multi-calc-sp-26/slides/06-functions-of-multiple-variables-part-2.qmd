### Strategies for plotting graphs of $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$

1. Intersect the graph with horizontal planes of the form $z=c$, for various values of $c$.
    - The equation you solve is $c = f(x,y)$.
    - These **cross sections** (also called **level sets**!) are curves in the $xy$-plane.

2. Intersect the graph with vertical planes of the form $x=c$, for various values of $c$.
    - The equation you solve is $z=f(c,y)$.
    - These **cross sections** are curves in the $yz$-plane.

3. Intersect the graph with vertical planes of the form $y=c$, for various values of $c$.
    - The equation you solve is $z=f(x,c)$.
    - These **cross sections** are curves in the $xz$-plane.

## Exercise 1: Practice with cross sections {.scrollable}

::: {.callout-note icon="false" .nonincremental appearance="minimal"}

Plot the graphs of the following functions by using cross sections.

1. $f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$
2. $g(x,y) = y\sin{x}$
3. $h(x,y) = -2x - y +5$
4. $k(x,y) = y^3 + xy$

## Contour plots {.scrollable}

::: {.callout-note icon="false" .fragment appearance="minimal"}

Placing all of the level sets of a function $f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ in the $xy$-plane gives us a **contour plot** of $f$.
:::

- So, a contour plot is like a topographic map of the graph of $f$.
- In this context, the level sets are often called **contours** or **contour lines**.

## Exercise 2: Matching contour plots {.scrollable}

Match the graphs to the contour plots.
