# Warm-up exercises


## Exercise 1: Temperatures

::: {.callout-note icon="false" .nonincremental appearance="minimal"}

Suppose a $3$-dimensional coordinate system has been set up in the classroom. The temperature, $T$, in degrees Fahrenheit, at a point in the classroom is a function of the coordinates $(x,y,z)$ of that point, $T = f(x,y,z)$. Suppose that distances are measured in feet, and that

$$
T = f(x,y,z) = 0.5x + 0.25y - 0.1z + 70.
$$

a. What is the temperature at the point $(0,0,0)$?

b. What is the temperature at the point $(2,4,10)$?

c. For every foot moved in the positive $x$-direction, how much does the temperature change?

d. For every foot moved in the positive $y$-direction, how much does the temperature change?

e. For every foot moved in the positive $z$-direction, how much does the temperature change?

## Exercise 2: Production costs

::: {.callout-note icon="false" .nonincremental appearance="minimal"}

A factory produces custom furniture. The total cost to produce one item of furniture, $C$, in dollars, depends on four variables:

- $x$ = number of workers assigned
- $y$ = hours of machine time used
- $z$ = square feet of wood used
- $w$ = gallons of finish/stain applied

The cost function is:
$$
C = f(x,y,z,w) = 25x + 15y + 3z + 12w + 200.
$$

a. What is the base cost (when $x=y=z=w=0$)?

b. What is the cost when $x=4$ workers, $y=8$ hours of machine time, $z=50$ square feet of wood, and $w=2$ gallons of finish are used?

c. How much does the cost increase for each additional worker?

d. How much does the cost increase for each additional square foot of wood?

e. How much does the cost increase for each additional gallon of finish?

## What do these exercises have in common?

- The function in Exercise 1 is of the form
$$
w = m(x-x_0) + n(y-y_0) + p(z-z_0) + w_0.
$$
- The function in Exercise 2 is of the form
$$
u = m(x-x_0) + n(y-y_0) + p(z-z_0) + q(w-w_0) + u_0.
$$
- Do you see the pattern?!


# Equations for hyperplanes

## Point-slope equations of "hyperplanes" {.scrollable}

- In two dimensions, we use the coordinates $(x,y)$.
- In three dimensions, we use the coordinates $(x,y,z)$.
- In four dimensions, we use the coordinates $(x,y,z,w)$.
- In five dimensions, we use the coordinates $(x,y,z,w, u)$.
- In $n$ dimensions, we use the coordinates $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$.

## The full story

::: {.callout-note icon="false" .fragment}
### Point-slope equation for a hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^n$

A **point-slope equation** for a hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is
$$
x_n = m_1(x_1-p_1) + m_2(x_2-p_2) + \cdots + m_{n-1}(x_{n-1}-p_{n-1}) + p_{n},
$$

where $(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{n})$ is a point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_{n-1}$ are the slopes in the positive $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, $x_{n-1}$ directions.

:::

- You can't *see* the graphs of these hyperplanes when $n>3$, but that doesn't mean these are imaginary objects with no real-world applications.
- If you doubt this, just look back at Exercises 1 and 2.
