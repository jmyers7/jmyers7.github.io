## Exercise 1: Point-slope equations for planes

Recall that the *point-slope equation* for a plane through a point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ with slope $m$ in the positive $x$-direction and slope $n$ in the positive $y$-direction is

$$
z = m(x-x_0) + n(y-y_0) + z_0.
$$

::: {.callout-note icon="false" appearance="minimal"}

a. Find the point-slope equation for a plane through the point $(2, -1, 4)$ with slope $3$ in the positive $x$-direction and slope $-2$ in the positive $y$-direction.

b. Find the point-slope equation for a plane through the origin with slope $1$ in the positive $x$-direction and slope $5$ in the positive $y$-direction.

c. The point-slope equation of a plane is
    $$
    z = -2(x+3) + 4(y-1) + 7.
    $$
    Through what point does this plane pass? What are the slopes in the $+x$ and $+y$ directions?

d. The point-slope equation of a plane is
    $$
    z = 5y - 2.
    $$
    Through what point does this plane pass? What are the slopes in the $+x$ and $+y$ directions?

e. Find the point-slope equation for a plane through the point $(1, 1, 1)$ that is parallel to the $xy$-plane.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Solutions.

a. $z = 3(x-2) - 2(y+1) + 4$

b. $z = x + 5y$

c. The plane passes through $(-3, 1, 7)$. The slope in the $+x$ direction is $-2$, and the slope in the $+y$ direction is $4$.

d. The plane passes through $(0, 0, -2)$, has slope $0$ in the $+x$ direction, and slope $5$ in the $+y$ direction.

e. A plane parallel to the $xy$-plane has slope $0$ in both the $+x$ and $+y$ directions. So the equation is $z = 0(x-1) + 0(y-1) + 1$, or simply $z = 1$.

## Exercise 2: Normal vectors to planes

Recall that a vector $\mathbf{n}$ is called a *normal vector* to a plane if it is orthogonal to all vectors that lie in the plane. For a plane with point-slope equation

$$
z = m(x-x_0) + n(y-y_0) + z_0,
$$

a normal vector is given by $\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} -m \\ -n \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.

::: {.callout-note icon="false" appearance="minimal"}

b. Find a normal vector to the plane $z = x + 5y$.

c. Find a normal vector to the plane $z = -4x + 2y - 1$.

d. Find a normal vector to the plane $z = 7$.

e. Find a normal vector to the plane $y = 3$.

f. Is $\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} -6 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$ also a normal vector to the plane $z = 3(x-2) - 2(y+1) + 4$? Explain.

:::
::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Solutions.

a. $\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

b. $\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ -5 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

c. $\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

d. $\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.

e. $\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{e}_2$.

f. Yes. Notice that $\begin{bmatrix} -6 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = 2\begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$. Any scalar multiple (except zero) of a normal vector is also a normal vector.

## Exercise 3: Vector equations of planes

Recall that the *vector equation* of a plane with normal vector $\mathbf{n}$ passing through the point with position vector $\mathbf{r}_0$ is

$$
\langle \mathbf{n}, \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0 \rangle = 0,
$$

where $\mathbf{r} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}$ is a variable position vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

:::
::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Solutions.

a. $z = -\frac{2}{3}(x-1) + \frac{1}{3}(y-0) - 2$

b. $z = -x - y$

## Exercise 4: Finding planes from geometric information

::: {.callout-note icon="false" appearance="minimal"}

a. Find a point-slope equation of the plane passing through the points $(1, 0, 2)$, $(2, 1, 3)$, and $(0, 1, 1)$.

b. Find a point-slope equation of the plane that contains the point $(0, 1, 1)$ and the $x$-axis.

c. Find a plane that passes through the point $(2, -1, 3)$ and is perpendicular to the vector
    $$
    \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
    $$

d. Find the point-slope equation of the plane that is parallel to the $xz$-plane and passes through the point $(1, 3, 2)$, if possible. If no such equation exists, explain why, and which equation you would use instead.

:::
::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Solutions.

a. Let
$$
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{r}_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$
be position vectors for the three points. Two vectors in the plane are
$$
\mathbf{v}_1 = \mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{r}_3 - \mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
We need a vector
$$
\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{bmatrix}
$$
orthogonal to both:
$$
\langle \mathbf{n}, \mathbf{v}_1 \rangle = a + b + c = 0, \quad \langle \mathbf{n}, \mathbf{v}_2 \rangle = -a + b - c = 0.
$$
From the second equation, $b = a + c$. Substituting into the first: $a + (a+c) + c = 0$, so $2a + 2c = 0$, giving $c = -a$. Then $b = a + (-a) = 0$.
Choosing $a = 1$, we get the normal vector
$$
\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Then, a point-slope equation of the plane is
$$
z = (x-1) + 2.
$$

b. A normal vector to the plane is
$$
\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Using this, we get a point-slope equation
$$
z = (y-1) + 1
$$

c. If the plane is perpendicular to $\mathbf{v}$, then $\mathbf{v}$ is a normal vector. So
$$
\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Then a point-slope equation of the plane is
$$
z = (x-2) + 2(y+1) + 3
$$

d. A plane parallel to the $xz$-plane has normal vector
$$
\mathbf{e}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
But this can't be written in the form
$$
\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} -m \\ -n \\ 1 \end{bmatrix},
$$
so no point-slope equation exists for this plane. Instead, we use the standard form:
$$
y-3 = 0.
$$

## Exercise 5: Temperature distribution

::: {.callout-note icon="false" appearance="minimal"}

The temperature $T$ (in degrees Celsius) at a point $(x, y, z)$ in a room is modeled by a linear function. Measurements show that:

- At the point $(0, 0, 0)$, the temperature is $20°C$.
- As you move 1 meter in the positive $x$-direction, the temperature increases by $2°C$ per meter.
- As you move 1 meter in the positive $y$-direction, the temperature decreases by $1°C$ per meter.
- The temperature does not change as you move in the $z$-direction.

Because of the third bullet point, the temperature is actually a function of the form $T = f(x,y)$, independent of $z$.

a. Find a formula for $T = f(x, y)$.

b. What is the temperature at the point $(3, 2, 5)$?

c. Find all points where the temperature is exactly $25°C$.

d. Does the set of solutions in part (c) form a plane? If so, find a normal vector.

:::
::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Solutions.

a. Since temperature changes linearly with position and increases at $2°C$/meter in the $+x$ direction and decreases at $1°C$/meter in the $+y$ direction, and doesn't change with $z$, we have
   $$
   T = f(x,y)= 2x - y + 20.
   $$
   (Since $f(0,0,0) = 20$.)

b. $T = f(3, 2) = 24°C$.

c. Setting $T = 25$ and solving $f(x,y)=25$, we get:
$$
\begin{align*}
2x - y + 20 = 25\\
2x - y = 5.
\end{align*}
$$

d. Yes, the set of solutions forms a plane. Note that the equation can be rewritten in the standard form
$$
2(x-0) - (y+5)=0.
$$
Thus, a normal vector is
$$
\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

## Exercise 6: Standard equations of planes

Recall that a *standard equation* of a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ passing through the point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ with normal vector
$$
\mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{bmatrix}
$$
is given by
$$
a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0.
$$

::: {.callout-note icon="false" appearance="minimal"}

a. Find a standard equation of the plane with normal vector
    $$
    \mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    passing through the point $(1, 2, -1)$.

b. A standard equation of a plane is
    $$
    3(x-1) - 2(y+2) + 4z = 0.
    $$
    Find a normal vector to this plane and identify a point on the plane.

c. Expand the standard equation from part (a) to obtain an equation of the form $ax + by + cz = d$.

d. Consider the plane with point-slope equation $z = 2(x-1) - 3(y+1) + 4$. Write this in standard form.

:::
::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Solutions.

a. Using the formula with $a = 2$, $b = -3$, $c = 1$ and the point $(1, 2, -1)$:
   $$
   2(x-1) - 3(y-2) + (z+1) = 0.
   $$

b. The normal vector is
   $$
   \mathbf{n} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}.
   $$
   One point on the plane is $(1, -2, 0)$.

c. $2x - 3y + z = -5$

d. $2(x-1) - 3(y+1) - (z-4) = 0$
