title: "Multivariable Calculus"
toc: true
---

This course is an introduction to multivariable calculus. We will cover the following topics:

1. Vectors and matrices: We will learn about vector algebra, dot products, matrix operations, and determinants.
2. Calculus of functions of several variables: We will study limits, continuity, derivatives, and applications of all these concepts.
3. Multiple integrals: We will explore double and triple integrals, as well as applications such as volume and surface area.
4. Vector calculus: We will cover vector fields, line integrals, surface integrals, Green's theorem, Stokes' theorem, and the divergence theorem.
