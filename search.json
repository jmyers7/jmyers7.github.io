    "section": "Conditional PDFs and graphical structures",
    "text": "Conditional PDFs and graphical structures\nAs mentioned above, a GMM combines several individual gaussians, each called a component of the mixture. Generating a sample \\(x\\) from a GMM involves two steps:\n\nSelect a component from which to generate \\(x\\).\nSample \\(x\\) from the chosen component gaussian.\n\nThe key insight is that components need not be selected with equal probability. Each component has an associated weight that determines its selection probability in step 1.\nTo formalize the selection process, we introduce the categorical distribution. Suppose given non-negative real numbers \\(\\phi_1,\\phi_2,\\ldots,\\phi_m\\) that sum to \\(1\\):\n\\[\n\\phi_1 + \\phi_2 + \\cdots + \\phi_m =1.\n\\]\nWe say that a discrete random variable \\(Y\\) has a categorical distribution, written\n\\[\nY \\sim \\mathcal{C}at(\\phi_1,\\phi_2,\\ldots,\\phi_m),\n\\tag{1}\\]\nif its probability mass function has the form\n\\[\np(y) = \\begin{cases}\n\\phi_y & : y=1,2,\\ldots,m, \\\\\n0 & : \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWe can now describe GMM sampling more precisely. For a GMM with \\(m\\) components where the \\(i\\)-th component has weight \\(\\phi_i\\), and \\(Y\\) a categorical random variable as in Equation 1, the sampling scheme above becomes:\n\nSample \\(y\\) from the categorical distribution \\(Y\\).\nGiven \\(y\\), sample \\(x\\) from the \\(y\\)-th component gaussian.\n\nThis natural progression from component selection to data generation is often called forward sampling, for obvious reasons.\nWe can visualize this sampling process with a simple graphical representation:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, \\(Y\\) represents the categorical random variable that encodes component weights, while \\(X\\) represents the random variable from which we sample our observation \\(x\\). The arrow captures the “forward” direction of the sampling process: first select a component, then generate data from it. This diagram illustrates the GMM as a simple example of a probabilistic graphical model (or PGM)—a topic I’ll explore in depth in future posts.\nThe mathematical relationship between these variables is straightforward. Given that component \\(y\\) has been selected, the conditional distribution of \\(X\\) is gaussian:\n\\[\n(X \\mid Y=y) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_y,\\sigma_y^2).\n\\]\nThis conditional distribution corresponds exactly to the \\(y\\)-th component of our GMM. Notice that both the mean \\(\\mu_y\\)​ and standard deviation \\(\\sigma_y\\) are component-specific, allowing each gaussian in the mixture to have its own location and spread.\nA GMM thus has two different types of parameters:\n\nThe component weights \\(\\phi_1,\\phi_2,\\ldots,\\phi_m\\).\nFor each \\(y=1,2,\\ldots,m\\), the guassian parameters \\(\\mu_y\\) and \\(\\sigma_y\\).\n\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, in this post we assume that these parameters are fixed and known. Later, we will learn how to estimate them from data."

    "section": "Marginal PDFs",
    "text": "Marginal PDFs\nThe marginal distribution of \\(X\\) follows directly from the law of total probability: \\[\nf(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^m p(y)f(x|y)  = \\sum_{k=1}^m \\phi_k f(x|k),\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere the conditional densities are normal:\n\\[\nf(x|k) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_k\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\left[ - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x-\\mu_k}{\\sigma_k}\\right)^2\\right].\n\\]\nThus, the marginal density \\(f(x)\\) is a convex linear combination of normal densities.\nNow let’s examine the specific \\(3\\)-component GMM that generated our dataset. The component parameters are:\n\\[\n(\\mu_1,\\sigma_1) = (10, 1), \\quad (\\mu_2,\\sigma_2) = (15, 2), \\quad (\\mu_3,\\sigma_3) = (21, 0.5),\n\\]\nwith weights:\n\\[\n(\\phi_1,\\phi_2,\\phi_3) = (0.2, 0.7, 0.1).\n\\]\nNotice that the middle component (centered at 15) dominates with 70% weight, while the outer components contribute 20% and 10% respectively.\nLet’s implement and visualize the component gaussians and the marginal PDF in Python. First, let’s load the parameters:\n\nnorm_params = [\n  {\"loc\": 10, \"scale\": 1},\n  {\"loc\": 15, \"scale\": 2},\n  {\"loc\": 21, \"scale\": 0.5}\n]\nweights = [0.2, 0.7, 0.1]\n\nNow, we plot the individual components, each scaled by its weight:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport scipy.stats as ss\n\nmesh = np.linspace(7, 23, num=200)\n\nfor k, (param, weight) in enumerate(zip(norm_params, weights)):\n  X = ss.norm(**param)\n  plt.plot(mesh, weight * X.pdf(mesh), color=colors[k], label=f\"component {k+1}\")\n\nplt.xlabel(\"x\")\nplt.ylabel(\"density\")\nplt.title(\"gaussian components\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\nplt.close()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marginal PDF implementation follows Equation 2 directly:\n\ndef marginal_pdf(x):  \n  return sum([weight * ss.norm(**param).pdf(x) for weight, param in zip(weights, norm_params)])\n\nFinally, we plot the theoretical marginal PDF against the empirical histogram:\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndata = np.load(\"../../data/gmm-data.npy\")\n\nsns.histplot(data=data, color=yellow, alpha=0.25, ec=grey, zorder=2, stat=\"density\", label=\"data\")\nplt.plot(mesh, marginal_pdf(mesh), color=blue, label=\"marginal PDF\")\nplt.xlabel(\"x\")\nplt.ylabel(\"density\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\nplt.close()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe close agreement between our theoretical marginal PDF and the empirical histogram confirms that our synthetic dataset faithfully represents the underlying GMM. Notice how the theoretical curve captures all three modes: the subtle left peak around \\(x=10\\), the dominant central peak near \\(x=15\\), and the sharp right peak at \\(x=21\\). The varying heights and widths of these peaks directly reflect the component weights and standard deviations we specified."

But in practice, the real challenge is the inverse problem we mentioned earlier: we are usually given a dataset and want to fit a GMM by estimating its parameters. How do we tease apart the hidden components, estimate their weights, and recover the underlying mixture? That puzzle leads directly to one of the most beautiful iterative methods in statistics and machine learning: the expectation–maximization algorithm, which will be the focus of the next post in this series."

    "text": "I’m a Ph.D. mathematician and university professor with a background that spans both theoretical and applied mathematics. My undergraduate education was in applied and computational mathematics with a minor in physics. In graduate school and through the first few years of my research career, I specialized in homological algebra and commutative ring theory, focusing on the bridge between modern algebra and geometry and topology. However, my interests have gradually shifted toward more practical domains, where I now work with machine learning, AI, statistics, and probability, with particular interest in industry applications. You can find my early mathematical research on my arXiv page.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to my role as a mathematician, I am also an educator who has taught 13 distinct college mathematics courses ranging from introductory calculus, to applied engineering mathematics, to upper-division theoretical courses, and have been recognized with teaching awards for my classroom work. Notable among these was a novel course in my dissertation research areas of commutative ring theory and algebraic geometry—topics not often taught at the undergraduate level—and a year-long course in probabilistic machine learning for which I wrote the textbook and developed the supporting infrastructure, all available in the navigation bar at the top.\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematics has a unique duality: it’s both deeply theoretical and remarkably practical. The abstract concepts that fascinate pure mathematicians frequently evolve into the foundations of the algorithms and technological systems that shape our daily lives. This website explores that arc from theory to application, sharing writings on mathematics, probability, machine learning, and their real-world intersections. Writing helps me clarify my own understanding as I continue learning across these fields. Whether you’re a student, researcher, or practitioner, I hope you’ll find ideas and resources here that inform and inspire."
