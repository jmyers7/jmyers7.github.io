::: {#def-ring}
Let $S$ be a set and let $\calR$ be a nonempty set of subsets of $S$. Then $\calR$ is called a *ring* if it is closed under binary unions and relative complements.
:::

::: {#def-semiring}
Let $S$ be a set and let $\calS$ be a set of subsets of $S$. Then $\calS$ is called a *semi-ring* if it contains the empty set, it is closed under binary intersections, and if every relative complement of sets in $\calS$ is a finite union of disjoint sets in $\calS$.
:::

::: {#thm-ring-semiring}
Let $\calR$ be a ring of sets in a set $S$. Then $\calR$ is a semi-ring.
:::

::: {.proof}
Choosing an $A\in \calR$, note that $\emptyset = A\smallsetminus A$, so that $\calR$ contains the empty set. Since
$$
A\cap B = A\smallsetminus (A\smallsetminus B)
$$
for $A,B\in \calR$, we see that $\calR$ is closed under binary intersections. Finally, since $\calR$ is itself closed under relative complements, it satisfies the last property for a semi-ring. Q.E.D.
:::

For the next definition, we suppose that we have $(S,\calB_S)$, where $S$ is a topological space and $\calB_S$ is its Borel $\sigma$-field. If $A\subset S$ is a topological space subspace, then it has its own Borel $\sigma$-field $\calB_A$ generated by the subspace topology inherited from $S$. Since this topology guarantees that the inclusion map $iota:A\to S$ is continuous, the inclusion map is also measurable. Thus, we have that $\iota^{-1}\calB_S \subset \calB_A$, since the first $\sigma$-field is the coarest onen for which $\iota$ is measurable. However, every relative open set $U\cap A$, for $U\subset S$ open, is contained in $\iota^{-1}\calB_S$ because $U\in \calB_S$ and $U\cap A = \iota^{-1}U$. But $\calB_A$ is generated by all sets of the form $U\cap A$, and hence we have $\calB_A \subset \iota^{-1}\calB_S$. Thus, these two $\sigma$-fields are equal.

::: {#def-borel-space}
Let $(S,\calS)$ and $(T,\calT)$ be two measurable spaces.

1. An *isomorphism* from $(S,\calS)$ to $(T,\calT)$ is a bijective function $f:S\to T$ for which both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are measurable.

2. The measurable space $(S,\calS)$ is called a *Borel space* if it is  isomorphic to a Borel set in $[0,1]$, where the latter is equipped with its Borel $\sigma$-field generated its subspace topology.
:::

For example, the real line $\bbr$ equipped with its Borel $\sigma$-field is a Borel space, since it is homeomorphic to the open interval $(0,1)$. In fact, every euclidean space $\bbr^k$ is a Borel space, which follows from the next important result. To state it, we first recall that a topological space is called a *Polish space* if it is separable and its topology can be generated by a complete metric. Thus, each $\bbr^k$ is a Polish space.

::: {#thm-borel-polish}
Every Polish space is a Borel space.
:::

::: {#def-localized-Borel}
Let $(S,\calS)$ be a Borel space. A *localizing sequence* is a sequence of sets $(S_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ in $\calS$ for which $S_n \uparrow S$. Given such a localizing sequence, a subset $B\subset S$ is called *bounded* (relative to the given localizing sequence) if $B\subset S_n$ for some $n$. We write $\hat{\calS}$ for the set of bounded sets in $\calS$. A *localized Borel space* is a Borel space equipped with a choice of localizing sequence.
:::

The Borel space $(\bbr,\calB_\bbr)$ can be equipped with a localizing sequence given by the open balls centered at $0$:
$$
B(0;1) \subset B(0;2) \subset \cdots \subset B(0;n) \subset \cdots \subset \bbr.
$$

::: {#def-dissecting}
Let $S$ be a topological space and suppose that the pair $(S,\calB_S)$ is a localized Borel space. A class $\calC \subset \hat{\calB}_S$ is *dissecting* if every open set $U$ is a countable union of sets in $\calC$, and every set $B\in \hat{\calB}_S$ is covered by finitely many sets in $\calC$.
:::


::: {#thm-bounded-ring}
Let $(S_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a localizing sequence for a Borel space $(S,\calS)$. Then the set $\hat{\calS}$ is a ring.
:::

::: {#def-locally-finite-measure}
A measure $\mu$ on a localized Borel space $(S,\calS)$ is called *locally finite* if $\mu B<\infty$ for all $B\in \hat{\calS}$. We write $\calM_S$ for the class of all such measures.
:::

Let $\calM_S$ be the set of locally finite measures on a localized Borel space $(S,\calS)$. For each $B\in \calS$, we have the evaluation map
$$
\pi_B: \calM_S \to \overline{\bbr}, \quad \mu \mapsto \mu B.
$$
We equip $\calM_S$ with the $\sigma$-field generated by these maps, as $B$ varies over all measureable sets $B\in \calS$. This $\sigma$-field is the smallest one for which each $\pi_B$ is measurable.
