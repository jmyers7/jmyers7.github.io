## Introduction

## Random variables as information carriers

We begin with the definition of these *level sets*:

::: {#def-rv-part}
Let $X:\Omega\to \bbr$ be a real-valued function on a set $\Omega$. For $x\in X$, sets of the form

$$
X^{-1}(x) \defeq \{ \omega \in \Omega : X(\omega)=x\}
$$

are called *level sets*.
:::

As you may easily check, the nonempty level sets of a function $X:\Omega \to \bbr$ partition its domain (assumed to be finite), and through this partition the function $X$ generates an algebra of sets in $\Omega$ denoted $\sigma(X)$. By @thm-atom-gen, the nonempty level sets are the atoms of this algebra.

Thus, the function $X$ is a carrier of information. If $\Omega$ consists of the outcomes of an experiment, the information encoded in the algebra $\sigma(X)$ allows an observer to decide whether $\omega \in X^{-1}(x)$ for each $x\in \bbr$, and thus the observer can determine the value $X(\omega)$.

::: {#thm-rv-refine}
## Random variables and refinements
Let $\calF$ be an algebra of sets in a finite set $\Omega$, and let $X:\Omega \to \bbr$ be a function.

1. The algebra $\calF$ refines $\sigma(X)$ if and only if $X$ is constant on every atom in $\calF$.

2. The algebra $\sigma(X)$ refines $\calF$ if and only if every atom in $\calF$ is a union of level sets of $X$.

## Proof.
By @thm-refinement, the algebra $\calF$ refines $\sigma(X)$ if and only if every nonempty level set is a union of atoms in $\calF$. This proves the result in the first statement. A symmetric argument using the same theorem proves the second statement. <span class="qed">Q.E.D.</span>
:::

It will be convenient to adopt some terminology from measure theory:

::: {#def-measurable}
Let $\calF$ be an algebra of sets in a finite set $\Omega$. A function $X:\Omega \to \bbr$ will be called *$\calF$-measurable* if $\calF$ refines the algebra $\sigma(X)$.
